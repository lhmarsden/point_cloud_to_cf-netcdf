# Notes

## Possible data formats for point clouds

PLY
LAS -
ASCII
COPC

Less used
Bently Pointtools
Polygon file format (small objects)
Autocad

Could also be DEM but this is basically an ASCII file, right?

All include coordinates

Can include some software dependent information.

## Lat lon

Should have an option where X/Y/Z are lon/lat/altitude and the user can specify this.
